Ubuntu changed their settings and keyboard gui options, you now need to install gnome tweaks to switch the needed keys

First go to the usual system settings and set the keyboard to Norwegian (Macintosh).

Then install the GNOME Tweaks Tool:
```
sudo apt install gnome-tweaks
```

Open Tweaks,Click Keyboard, then "Additional Options"

Press “Alt and Win behavior” and choose “Ctrl is mapped to Win and the usual Ctrl”.
Press “Key to choose 3rd level” and select "Left Alt".
